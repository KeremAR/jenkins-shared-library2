/**
 * Feature Branch Unit Test Runner
 * 
 * This function runs unit tests ONLY for services that have changed
 * compared to the main branch. This speeds up feedback for developers.
 * 
 * Features:
 * - Detects changed services via git diff against main branch
 * - Runs only tests for changed services
 * - No coverage reports (for speed)
 * - Fast feedback loop
 * 
 * Usage:
 *   featureUnitTest(services: config.unitTestServices)
