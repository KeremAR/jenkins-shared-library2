/**
 * Get Changed Services
 * 
 * Detects which services have changed compared to the main branch.
 * This is used for feature branch optimization - only test/build what changed.
 * 
 * Features:
 * - Fetches main branch for comparison
 * - Uses git diff to find changed files
 * - Maps changed files to services
 * - Returns list of changed services
 * 
 * Usage:
 *   def changedServices = getChangedServices(services: config.services)
 *   if (changedServices.isEmpty()) {
 *       echo "No service changes detected"
 *   }
 * 
 * @param services List of service configurations with 'name' field
 * @return List of services that have changes
